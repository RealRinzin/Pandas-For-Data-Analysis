# Pandas Basic for Data Analysis

``` Python
import pandas as pd
```

Pandas can be used to load data from various sources, such as CSV and Excel files.
The read_csv function is used to load data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
To read a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file in Python using the Pandas library, you can use the pd.read_csv() function. Here's the syntax to read a CSV file:

``` Python
import pandas as pd
```
## Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
``` Python
df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')
```
Replace 'your_file.csv' with the actual file path of your CSV file. Make sure that the file is located in the same directory as your Python script, or you provide the correct file path.

What is a Series?
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in Pandas. It can be thought of as a single column of data with labels or indices for each element. You can create a Series from various data sources, such as lists, NumPy arrays, or dictionaries
Here's a basic example of creating a Series in Pandas:

``` Python
import pandas as pd
```
## Create a Series from a list
``` Python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)
```
In this example, we've created a Series named s with numeric data. Notice that Pandas automatically assigned numerical indices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to each element, but you can also specify custom labels if needed.

Accessing Elements in a Series
You can access elements in a Series using the index labels or integer positions. Here are a few common methods for accessing Series data:

Accessing by label
``` Python

print(s[2])     # Access the element with label 2 (value 30)
```
Accessing by position
``` Python

print(s.iloc[3]) # Access the element at position 3 (value 40)
```
Accessing multiple elements
``` Python

print(s[1:4])   # Access a range of elements by label
```
Creating DataFrames from Dictionaries:
DataFrames can be created from dictionaries, with keys as column labels and values as lists representing rows.

``` Python
import pandas as pd
```
## Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
``` Python

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
        'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
Column Selection:
You can select a single column from a DataFrame by specifying the column name within double brackets.
Multiple columns can be selected in a similar manner, creating a new DataFrame.

``` Python

print(df['Name'])  # Access the 'Name' column
```
Accessing Rows:
You can access rows by their index using .iloc[] or by label using .loc[].

``` Python
print(df.iloc[2])   # Access the third row by position
print(df.loc[1])    # Access the second row by label
```
Slicing:
You can slice DataFrames to select specific rows and columns.

``` Python
print(df[['Name', 'Age']])  # Select specific columns
print(df[1:3])             # Select specific rows
```
Finding Unique Elements:
Use the unique method to determine the unique elements in a column of a DataFrame.

``` Python
unique_dates = df['Age'].unique()
```
Conditional Filtering:
You can filter data in a DataFrame based on conditions using inequality operators.
For instance, you can filter albums released after a certain year.

``` Python
high_above_102 = df[df['Age'] > 25]
```
Saving DataFrames:
To save a DataFrame to a CSV file, use the to_csv method and specify the filename with a “.csv” extension.Pandas provides other functions for saving DataFrames in different formats.

``` Python
df.to_csv('trading_data.csv', index=False)
```
DataFrame Attributes and Methods
DataFrames provide numerous attributes and methods for data manipulation and analysis, including:
``` Python
shape: Returns the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the DataFrame.
info(): Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.
describe(): Generates summary statistics for numerical columns.
head(), tail(): Displays the first or last n rows of the DataFrame.
mean(), sum(), min(), max(): Calculate summary statistics for columns.
sort_values(): Sort the DataFrame by one or more columns.
groupby(): Group data based on specific columns for aggregation.
fillna(), drop(), rename(): Handle missing values, drop columns, or rename columns.
apply(): Apply a function to each element, row, or column of the 
```
